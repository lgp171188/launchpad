# System-installed Python packages to link into our virtualenv.  This
# facility should be reserved for cases where installing them as a normal
# Python dependency is impossible or unreliable (perhaps due to frequent ABI
# changes in system libraries they depend on, or frequent security updates
# managed by the distribution's security team).
#
# The syntax is based on that of PEP 508 requirements, although only
# name-based requirements are permitted, possibly with environment markers,
# and the names are top-level package names rather than distribution names.
# Lines that begin with "[optional]" are optional, in that
# link-system-packages will not fail if they are missing; this should be
# reserved for packages only used by the test suite.
