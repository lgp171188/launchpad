        """Return a dict of Artifactory properties to set for this file.

        Artifactory properties are used (among other things) to describe how
        a file should be indexed, in a similar sort of way to active
        publishing records in Launchpad.  However, the semantics are a
        little different where combinations of publishing dimensions are
        involved.  Launchpad has a publishing history record for each
        position in the matrix of possible publishing locations, while
        Artifactory takes the cross product of a file's properties: for
        example, a package might be published in Launchpad for focal/amd64,
        focal/i386, and jammy/amd64, but if we set `"deb.distribution":
        ["focal", "jammy"], "deb.architecture": ["amd64", "i386"]` then
        Artifactory will add that file to the indexes for all of
        focal/amd64, focal/i386, jammy/amd64, jammy/i386.

        In practice, the particular set of publishing dimensions we use for
        Debian-format PPAs means that this usually only matters in corner
        cases: PPAs only have a single component ("main"), and the only
        files published for more than one architecture are those for
        "Architecture: all" packages, so this effectively only matters when
        architectures are added or removed between series.  It does mean
        that we can't produce a faithful rendition of PPAs in Artifactory
        without splitting up the pool, since we also need to do things like
        overriding the section and phasing differently across series.

        For other indexing formats, we care about channels, which are set as
        properties and then used to generate subsidiary Artifactory
        repositories.  Those potentially intersect with series: a given file
        might be in "stable" for focal but in "candidate" for jammy.  To
        avoid problems due to this, we need to express channels to
        Artifactory in a way that doesn't cause files to end up in incorrect
        locations in the series/channel matrix.  The simplest approach is to
        prefix the channel with the series (actually suite), so that the
        above example might end up as `"launchpad.channel": ["focal:stable",
        "jammy:candidate"]`.  This can easily be matched by AQL queries and
        used to generate more specific repositories.

        Note that all the property values here must be sorted lists, even if
        those are single-item lists.  If we use simple strings, then things
        mostly work because `artifactory.encode_properties` will still
        encode them properly, but they won't match the values returned by
        the AQL search via `ArtifactoryPool.getAllArtifacts`, and so
        `updateProperties` will always try to update them even if there
        aren't really any changes.

        We also set an assortment of additional metadata items, specified in
        https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Xkdi-CRu2NiQfLoclP5PKW63Zw6syiuao8VJG7zxvw
