Priority: Low
Priority-Reason: 'Unrealistic exploitation scenario. Logs are stored locally and not
  transferred between agents, so local log access is the only conceivable method to
  view the password for the redis instance (i.e., no possibility of MitM to access
  the logs). Given the requirement for priviledged system access to access log files
  the real "danger" posed by the vulnerability is quite low, and that is reflected
  in this priority assignment. '

Candidate: CVE-2025-1979
Description: "Versions of the package ray before 2.43.0 are vulnerable to Insertion\
  \ of Sensitive Information into Log File where the redis password is being logged\
  \ in the standard logging. If the redis password is passed as an argument, it will\
  \ be logged and could potentially leak the password.\r\rThis is only exploitable\
  \ if:\r\r1) Logging is enabled;\r\r2) Redis is using password authentication;\r\r\
  3) Those logs are accessible to an attacker, who can reach that redis instance.\r\
  \r**Note:**\r\rIt is recommended that anyone who is running in this configuration\
  \ should update to the latest version of Ray, then rotate their redis password."
