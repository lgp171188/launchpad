                <strong>Launchpad makes it easy for anyone to get your project's code using Git or Bazaar, make their own changes with full version control, and then propose their work for merging back into your trunk.</strong>

            <p class="intro-text">
                Full control of who can land code in your project's trunk remains with you. And thanks to public code reviews, you can share the work of vetting proposed changes.

                            With Launchpad, contributors can create their own branch of your code using Git or Bazaar, make their changes and then push it all back up to Launchpad to be listed right alongside your official branches.</p><br />
                       <p> And because they never touch your trunk they don&rsquo;t need to ask for commit access.</p><br />
                        <p>So, with no extra effort on your part new contributors can submit code to your project and propose it for merging into your trunk.</p>

                        <p>On one page, Launchpad gives you a diff of the proposed change, a threaded discussion and the clarity of standard voting options along with the flexibility of tags to add nuance to your selection.</p><br />
                        <p>And each review becomes a mini-mailing list, automatically involving those most likely to have an interest in the change. <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Code/Review">More about code review &gt;</a></p><br />

                            Develop your fix in a Git or Bazaar branch and link it to the bug report. Anyone interested in the bug can track your progress and get access to your fix with a single command.

In effect, your branch becomes a living patch: the very latest version of your code is always available as direct link from the bug report.

All team members can commit to a centrally hosted branch, while anyone can still create their own separate line of development with full version control.
