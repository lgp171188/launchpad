    It does this by meshing together two sources of data:

      - feature flags, typically set by an administrator into the database

      - feature scopes, which would typically be looked up based on attributes
      of the current web request, or the user for whom a job is being run, or
      something similar.

    FeatureController presents a high level interface for application code to
    query flag values, without it needing to know that they are stored in the
    database.

    At this level flag names and scope names are presented as strings for
    easier use in Python code, though the values remain unicode.  They
    should always be ascii like Python identifiers.

    One instance of FeatureController should be constructed for the lifetime
    of code that has consistent configuration values.  For instance there will
    be one per web app request.

    Intended performance: when this object is first asked about a flag, it
    will read the whole feature flag table from the database.  It is expected
    to be reasonably small.  The scopes may be expensive to compute (eg
    checking team membership) so they are checked at most once when
    they are first needed.

    The controller is then supposed to be held in a thread-local and reused
    for the duration of the request.
