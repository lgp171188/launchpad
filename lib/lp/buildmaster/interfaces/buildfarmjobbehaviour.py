# models, but this is difficult while Launchpad runs on Python < 3.7.
# XXX cjwatson 2023-01-04: Several of these items are only valid for certain

# result, it's difficult to construct a completely accurate type declaration
# on Python 3.5.  In the meantime, job type constraints are noted in the
# comments with the type name (i.e. `IBuildFarmJobBehaviour.builder_type`)
