start-services:
  description: Start services.  Usually run after maintenance.
stop-services:
  description: |
    Stop services.  Usually run in preparation for maintenance.  (Note that
    this does not stop services in a way that will persist across a reboot.
    It also doesn't disable cron jobs, since those are handled by the
    cron-control mechanism instead; see
    lp.services.scripts.base.cronscript_enabled.)
