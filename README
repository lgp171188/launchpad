README for Launchpad
====================

Launchpad is an open source suite of tools that help people and teams to work
together on software projects.  Unlike many open source projects, Launchpad
isn't something you install and run yourself (although you are welcome to do
so), instead, contributors help make <https://launchpad.net> better.

Launchpad is a project of Canonical <http://www.canonical.com> and has
received many contributions from many wonderful people.

If you want help using Launchpad, then please visit our help wiki at:

    https://help.launchpad.net/

If you'd like to contribute to Launchpad, have a look at:

    https://documentation.ubuntu.com/launchpad/

Alternatively, have a poke around in the code, which you probably already know
how to get if you are reading this file.
